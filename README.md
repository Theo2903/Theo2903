# Hi there 👋

## ***About me***

🎓 Currently pursuing an apprenticeship in Geneva in my third year, I'm passionate about software development and innovation. With a strong command of JavaScript, including frontend frameworks/libraries like ReactJS, VueJS, and React Native, as well as Python with Django for backend development, I'm always on the lookout to expand my skills and take on new challenges.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - Swift / SwiftUI
- 🚧 Currently deeply engaged in a major side project, i'm fully dedicated to its development and not actively seeking collaboration at the moment. However, I'm always open to exchanging ideas and knowledge. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or just want to chat!
- Outside tech, 🏃‍♂️ I enjoy running/trail running, 🎵 listening to music, and 🏎️ motorsport.
